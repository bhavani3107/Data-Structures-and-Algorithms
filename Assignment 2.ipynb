    "\n",
    "2. **For Loop**:\n",

    "   - The inner loop compares adjacent elements in the list and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. It starts from index `0` and goes up to `n-i-1` (decreasing with each outer loop iteration).\n",
    "   - On the first outer loop iteration, the inner loop runs **n-1** times; on the second outer loop iteration, it runs **n-2** times; and so on, until it runs just **1** time on the last outer loop iteration.\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. **Comparison and Swap**:\n",
    "   - The comparison (`if lst[j] > lst[j+1]`) and the swap (`lst[j], lst[j+1] = lst[j+1], lst[j]`) are constant-time operations \\( O(1) \\).\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "The total number of operations is the sum of the inner loop iterations for each outer loop pass:\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "(n-1) + (n-2) + (n-3) + ... + 1 = \\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\n",
    "\\]\n",

    "### Best Case Scenario:\n",
    "- **Best case** occurs when the list is already sorted. In the current implementation, Bubble Sort does not optimize for this case (i.e., it still performs all the iterations, even though no swaps are made).\n",
    "- Hence, the **best-case time complexity** is also \\( O(n^2) \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Space Complexity:\n",
    "- The algorithm sorts the list **in-place**, meaning it doesn't require any extra space apart from the input list.\n",
    "- Therefore, the **space complexity** is \\( O(1) \\), constant space.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion:\n",
    "- **Time Complexity**: \\( O(n^2) \\), both in the average and worst-case scenarios.\n",
    "- **Space Complexity**: \\( O(1) \\), as no extra space is used beyond the input list."
